# Alarm Sound File

Place an MP3 file named `alarm_sound.mp3` in this directory.

## How to Add the Alarm Sound:

1. Download or create an alarm sound file (MP3 format)
2. Name it `alarm_sound.mp3`
3. Place it in this folder: `/Users/abhishek/Desktop/alram/assets/sounds/`

## Free Alarm Sound Resources:

- **Freesound.org**: https://freesound.org/search/?q=alarm&f=&s=score+desc
- **ZapSplat**: https://www.zapsplat.com/sound-effect-category/alarms/
- **Mixkit**: https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/alarm/

## Quick Fix (Temporary):

If you don't have a sound file yet, the app will still work. It will:
- Show notifications at the alarm time
- Display the alarm label
- Vibrate the device (on Android)
- Play the default notification sound

The app is fully functional even without the custom sound file!
